# User Manual

Example:

`pyan3 *.py --uses --no-defines --colored --grouped --annotated --dot >myuses.dot`

Then render using your favorite GraphViz filter, mainly `dot` or `fdp`:

`dot -Tsvg myuses.dot >myuses.svg`

## Troubleshooting

If GraphViz says _trouble in init_rank_, try adding `-Gnewrank=true`, as in:

`dot -Gnewrank=true -Tsvg myuses.dot >myuses.svg`

Usually either old or new rank (but often not both) works; this is a long-standing GraphViz issue with complex graphs.

## Reducing details

If the graph is visually unreadable due to too much detail, consider visualizing only a subset of the files in your project. Any references to files outside the analyzed set will be considered as undefined, and will not be drawn.

Currently Pyan always operates at the level of individual functions and methods; an option to visualize only relations between namespaces may (or may not) be added in a future version.
